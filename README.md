# Neural_Network_0-1_OCR
This was a workshop conducted under IEEE SIES GST, Focuses on understanding the core principles of Machine Learning. Here we covered concepts from basic Math used in computing a neuron to classifying 10 digit numbers using a fully connected Neural Network.
## Single Neuron Output.
$$ \text{neuron output} = \mathbf{input} \cdot \mathbf{weight} + bias $$
## Computing multiple neurons at once, also known as a layer of neurons.
$$ \text{output} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (\text{input}_i \cdot \text{weight}_i) + \text{biases} $$
Here input and weight are arrays of float values of which dot product is calculated.
